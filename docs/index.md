# Mission

Aurae is on a mission to be the most loved and effective way of managing
workloads on a node. Our hope is that by bringing a better set of controls to a
node, we can unlock brilliant higher order distributed systems in the future.

# Introduction

[Aurae] deploys a memory-safe [^memory-safe] runtime daemon, process manager,
and PID-1 initialization system to remotely schedule processes, containers, and
virtual machines as well as set node configurations (e.g., like networking
storage).

Through system proportioning and enterprise workload isolation techniques, the
Aurae [open-source] project can complement higher order schedulers and control
planes (such as Kubernetes) as Aurae supports the usage of multi-tenant
workloads and enterprise identities all the way down to the socket layer.

## Project Status

> **STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**<br>
> **The Aurae project and API can change without notice.**<br>
> **Do not run the project in production until further notice!**

- The Aurae project welcomes contributions of all kinds and sizes.
- Please read the "[getting involved]" documentation before contributing to the
  project.
- You do not have to know [Rust] to join the project.

By joining the project in its early stages, you will help to create a milestone
contender for corporate distributed systems and automation that will remain
accessible to anyone.

# **Expanded Overview**

By [introducing Aurae cells] on top of a [Linux kernel] the control of each
internal runtime process on a given node becomes possible. The auraed runtime
maintains ownership of every process by managing everything from [PID]-1 to
nested processes.

Maintainable and predefined [.proto]-files contribute to the core definition of
the distributed systems runtime and the standard library. During the build
process, these [.proto]-files can allow for greater customization possibilities.
The [TypeScript] file format replaces static manifests (like the [YAML] file
format) for direct interactions with a running system.

| :--- | :--- |
| **Auraed**      | To ensure memory safety, Aurae serves the generic system's runtime daemon ([auraed]).|
| **AuraeScript** | The [AuraeScript] (a Turing-complete scripting language built on TypeScript) library automatically generates itself from the pre-defined [.proto] files defined in the Aurae standard library.<br>It also directly embeds [Deno] source code to provide an SDK and the functionality to attach remote clients for the direct remote communication with Aurae. |
|||

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env auraescript
let cells = new runtime.CellServiceClient();

let allocated = await cells.allocate(<runtime.AllocateCellRequest>{
  cell: runtime.Cell.fromPartial({
    name: "my-cell",
    cpus: "2",
  }),
});

let started = await cells.start(<runtime.StartExecutableRequest>{
  executable: runtime.Executable.fromPartial({
    cellName: "my-cell",
    command: "sleep 4000",
    description: "Sleep for 4000 seconds",
    name: "sleep-4000",
  }),
});
```

| **Authentication**               | Aurae extends [SPIFFE]/[SPIRE] (x509 mTLS)-backed identity, authentication (authn), and authorization (authz) in a distributed system down to the Unix domain socket layer. |
| **Principle of Least Awareness** | A single Aurae instance has no awareness of higher order scheduling mechanisms such as the Kubernetes control plane.                                                        |
| **Runtime Workloads**            | The Aurae runtime API can manage [virtual machines], [executables], [cells], [pods], and other [spawned Aurae instances].                                                   |
| **The Aurae Standard Library**   | The Aurae project exposes its functionality as a gRPC API through the [Aurae standard library]. The [V0 API reference] contains the current library definition.             |

<!-- +Footnotes

[^cells]:
    Additionally, with Aurae cells, the project provides various ways to partition
    and slice up systems allowing for isolation strategies in enterprise workloads.

[^compare]:
    As a low-level building block, the Aurae Project works well with any
    higher-order system by offering a thoughtful set of API calls and controls for
    managing workloads on a single node.
