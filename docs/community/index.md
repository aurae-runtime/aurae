# What is Aurae? 

[AuraeScript](https://aurae.io/auraescript/) is an opinionated Turing complete scripting language built for the enterprise. Think of it like TypeScript for infrastructure platforms.

[Auraed](https://aurae.io/auraed/) is the project core runtime daemon, auth and identity management system, and gRPC server that listens on a Unix domain socket.
