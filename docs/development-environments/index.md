# Development Environments

In an effort to ease the process of getting started and contributing to the project, the community has documented development environments that are are expected to work. **Please note, x86_64 architecture is currently the only officially supported target for running the Aurae Daemon (auared).**

1. [Dev Container](dev-container)
    - Uses Visual Studio Code and Docker to quickly create a development environment on x86_64 and aarch64 architectures.
2. [Apple Silicon - CLion & Parallels Desktop](apple-silicon/clion-parallels)
    - Uses CLion and an Ubuntu VM via Parallels Desktop to provide a development environment with a GUI.
