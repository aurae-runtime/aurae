# This is the main compile time check for Aurae.
#
# This build check will introduce confidence for the following:
#
# - That the binary does not have unexpected dependencies.
# - We intentionally build this on a clean ubuntu image, to prove that we can
#   generate a static binary with minimal dependencies.
# - That the code does not warn (due to clippy errors/warnings)
#
# When this build passes we should have a "clean cargo" output!
