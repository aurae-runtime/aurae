# Security Policy

> **Warning**
> At this time, Aurae is in early development, and we do not recommend running it in any production environment. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You are welcome to report suspected security vulnerabilities to security@aurae.io. Due to Aurae's early development status, we may not respond or fix the issues reported, but we will use reports to help inform and prioritize our backlog. Once we have a release that we recommend for production, we will define a security SLA for the community.

In your report, please include as much detail as possible:

- the version/git sha of Aurae you are running
- your operating system distribution & version
- steps to reproduce
- expected behavior
- affected modules/lines of code
