# Releases

Releases are created in the [releases](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/release) project so that all projects can be built at the same time.

When a pre-release is created in that project, it will create a pre-release in this project with the same version. Notes will be autogenerated off the commit changes.

That pre-release will trigger the `050-release-ubuntu-make-build-release` pipeline in this project. This will create the artifacts using `make release` and then upload them to the pre-release created for this project.

When the pre-release in the `releases` project is approved by a maintainer and realeased, then this project will also get released.
